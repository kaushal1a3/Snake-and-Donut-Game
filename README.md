# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in Python using OpenCV and cvzone libraries. It offers an interactive gaming experience where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and the snake itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Control the direction of the snake using hand gestures detected by the camera.
- **Food Generation:** Randomly generate food on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Scoring:** Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed.
- **Collision Detection:** Detect collisions between the snake and the boundaries of the game screen or itself.
- **Game Over:** End the game when the snake collides with a boundary or itself, displaying the final score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the game:

    ```
    python snake_game.py
    ```

2. Control the snake's movement using hand gestures detected by the camera.
3. Eat food to grow longer and increase your score.
4. Avoid collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and the snake itself.
5. Press the 'r' key to restart the game after it ends.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement power-ups, different levels, and obstacles to enhance gameplay.
- Introduce a multiplayer mode for competitive or cooperative play.
- Incorporate artificial intelligence to create challenging computer-controlled opponents.
- Refine hand-tracking algorithms to support a wider range of gestures.
